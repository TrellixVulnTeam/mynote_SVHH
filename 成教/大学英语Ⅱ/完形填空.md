Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle viewed laughter as “a bodily exercise precious to health.” But ­­­__1___some claims to the contrary, laughing probably has little influence on physical fitness Laughter does __2___short-term changes in the function of the heart and its blood vessels, ___3_ heart rate and oxygen consumption But because hard laughter is difficult to __4__, a good laugh is unlikely to have __5___ benefits the way, say, walking or jogging does.

__6__, instead of straining muscles to build them, as exercise does, laughter apparently accomplishes the __7__, studies dating back to the 1930’s indicate that laughter__8___ muscles, decreasing muscle tone for up to 45 minutes after the laugh dies down.

Such bodily reaction might conceivably help _9__the effects of psychological stress. Anyway, the act of laughing probably does produce other types of ___10___ feedback, that improve an individual’s emotional state. __11____one classical theory of emotion, our feelings are partially rooted ____12___ physical reactions. It was argued at the end of the 19th century that humans do not cry ___13___they are sad but they become sad when the tears begin to flow.

Although sadness also ____14___ tears, evidence suggests that emotions can flow __15___ muscular responses. In an experiment published in 1988,social psychologist Fritz Strack of the University of würzburg in Germany asked volunteers to pick  a pen either with their teeth-thereby creating an artificial smile – or with their lips, which would produce a(n) disappointed expression. Those forced to exercise their smiling muscles reacted more exuberantly to funny cartons than did those whose mouths were contracted in a frown, mentioning that expressions may influence emotions rather than just the other way around Similarly , the physical act of laughter could improve mood.

3[填空题,20分]
Research on animal intelligence always makes me wonder just how smart humans are. 1  the fruit-fly experiments described in Carl Zimmer’s piece in the Science Times on Tuesday. Fruit flies who were taught to be smarter than the average fruit fly 2  to live shorter lives. This suggests that 3  bulbs burn longer, that there is an 4    in not being too terrifically bright.
Intelligence, it 5   out, is a high-priced option. It takes more upkeep, burns more fuel and is slow 6   the starting line because it depends on learning — a gradual 7   — instead of instinct. Plenty of other species are able to learn, and one of the things they’ve apparently learned is when to 8  .
Is there an adaptive value to 9   intelligence? That’s the question behind this new research. I like it. Instead of casting a wistful glance 10   at all the species we’ve left in the dust I.Q.-wise, it implicitly asks what the real 11   of our own intelligence might be. This is 12  the mind of every animal I’ve ever met.
Research on animal intelligence also makes me wonder what experiments animals would 13  on humans if they had the chance. Every cat with an owner, 14   , is running a small-scale study in operant conditioning. we believe that 15 animals ran the labs, they would test us to determine the limits of our patience, our faithfulness, our memory for terrain. They would try to decide what intelligence in humans is really for   , not merely how much of it there is. Above all , they would hope to study a fundamental question: Are humans actually aware of the world they live in? So far the results are inconclusive.

4[填空题,20分] The idea that some groups of people may be more intelligent than others is one of those hypotheses that dare not speak its name. But Gregory Cochran is 1  to say it anyway. He is that 2  bird, a scientist who works independently 3  any institution. He helped popularize the idea that some diseases not 4  thought to have a bacterial cause were actually infections, which aroused much controversy when it was first suggested.
5 he, however, might tremble at the 6  of what he is about to do. Together with another two scientists, he is publishing a paper which not only 7  that one group of humanity is more intelligent than the others, but explains the process that has brought this about. The group in 8 are a particular people originated from central Europe. The process is natural selection.
This group generally do well in IQ test, 9 12-15 points above the 10  value of 100, and have contributed 11  to the intellectual and cultural life of the West, as the 12  of their elites, including several world-renowned scientists,13 hey also suffer more often than most people from a number of nasty genetic diseases, such as breast cancer. These facts, 14 ave previously been thought unrelated. The former has been 15  social effects, such as a strong tradition of valuing ucation. The latter was seen as a (an) consequence genetic isolation. Dr. Cochran suggests that the intelligence and diseases are intimately  linked is argument is that the unusual history of these people has subjected em to unique evolutionary pressures that have resulted in this  paradoxical ate of affairs.

By 1830 the former Spanish and Portuguese colonies had become independent nations. The roughly 20 million of 1 these nations looked  2 to the future. Born in the crisis of the old regime and Iberian Colonialism, many of the leaders of independence 3 the ideals of representative government, careers 4 to talent, freedom of commerce and trade, the 5 to private property, and a belief in the individual as the basis of society. 6 there was a belief that the new nations should be sovereign and independent states, large enough to be economically viable and integrated by a 7 set of laws.

On the issue of 8 of religion and the position of the church,9  there was less agreement 10 the leadership. Roman Catholicism had been the state religion and the only one 11 by the Spanish crown. 12 most leaders sought to maintain Catholicism 13 the official religion of the new states, some sought to end the 14 of other faiths. The defense of the Church became a rallying  15 for the conservative forces.

The ideals of the early leaders of independence were often egalitarian, valuing equality of everything. Bolivar had received aid from Haiti and had promised in return to abolish slavery in the areas he liberated. By 1854 slavery had been abolished everywhere except Spain’s former colonies. Early promises to end Indian tribute and taxes on people of mixed origin came much tougher because the new nations still needed the revenue such policies contributed . Egalitarian sentiments were often tempered by fears that the mass of the population was unprepared for self-rule and democracy.
